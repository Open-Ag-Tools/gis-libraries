# Vector GIS File Formats: Pros and Cons

## 1. Shapefile (.shp)
**Pros:**
- Very widely supported across almost all GIS software (industry standard for decades)
- Simple format, easy to handle for small to medium datasets
- Human-readable attribute table (DBF)

**Cons:**
- Multiple files required (.shp, .shx, .dbf, etc.)
- Limited to 2 GB per file
- Attribute name limit (10 characters) and no native support for UTF-8
- No topology or advanced data model

**Best For:** Legacy projects and maximum interoperability, but not recommended for new development.

## 2. GeoJSON (.geojson / .json)
**Pros:**
- Human-readable, simple JSON structure
- Natively supported by web mapping frameworks (Leaflet, Mapbox, OpenLayers)
- Easily transferable over the web (REST APIs, web services)
- Open standard, no licensing restrictions

**Cons:**
- Larger file size compared to binary formats
- No built-in spatial indexing → slower for very large datasets
- Limited attribute storage and data types
- Precision issues for very detailed geometries

**Best For:** Web mapping, lightweight spatial data sharing, APIs.

## 3. GeoPackage (GPKG)
**Pros:**
- Single file (SQLite-based database)
- Supports **both vector and raster** in one file
- Open standard (OGC), widely adopted and modern
- Supports large datasets efficiently (up to multiple terabytes)
- Can store multiple layers and spatial indexes for fast querying

**Cons:**
- Slightly more complex than simple text formats (like GeoJSON)
- Not as ubiquitous as Shapefile (older software may not support it well)
- Editing in parallel (multiple users) is tricky compared to databases

**Best For:** Modern offline GIS projects, mobile apps, multi-layer portable GIS datasets.

## 4. FlatGeobuf (.fgb)
**Pros:**
- Very fast (streamable binary format with spatial indexing)
- Designed for **web + cloud streaming** use cases
- Open format, good for very large datasets
- Supported by modern GIS libraries (GDAL, QGIS, etc.)

**Cons:**
- Newer format → not universally supported yet
- Binary format (not human-readable like GeoJSON)
- Limited tooling compared to Shapefile and GeoPackage

**Best For:** Web/cloud mapping with very large vector datasets and fast queries.

## 5. File Geodatabase (.gdb)
**Pros:**
- Handles massive datasets efficiently
- Supports advanced data types, topology, and relationships
- Supported by ArcGIS and QGIS (read/write via GDAL)
- Good for enterprise workflows

**Cons:**
- Proprietary ESRI format (not fully open)
- Some features only fully supported in ArcGIS
- Complex structure (folder with multiple files)

**Best For:** ESRI-based enterprise workflows where performance and advanced GIS capabilities are required.
